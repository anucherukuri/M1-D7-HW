    <td> When it comes to lipstick, performance is essential. A lipstick should last throughout your workday,
     a coffee break, and even while sneaking a kiss. And then there's the application—it should be seamless,
     turizing, and smear-proof. This might seem like a dream, but we assure you, perfection does exist. </td>

    <td>There are countless ways to use eye pencils, but no matter what, makeup artist Rose Siard sticks to
     a specific technique: "As soon as you draw your line, start smudging," she says. "I work one eye at a 
     time so I have more blending time." And of course, the pencil you choose either makes this easier or 
     harder to do.

    <td>Eyebrow trends are a fickle beast. Their fashion seems to swing, pendulum like, between thin – think
    Friends” – and Cara Delevingne/Brooke Shields luxuriance. This makes for a few tricky in-between moments:
     no sooner have you plucked them into submission than bushy brows are back. </td>

    If you’ve ever had a bottle of bronzer explode in your bag, you know that the shimmery liquid looks 
    better on your face than on your wallet, phone, and whatever else you might have stashed in your purse.
    The simplest way to avoid this disaster? Pencils. Just as effective as their powdery palette and liquid 
    parts, an all-stick makeup routine is lighter and compact, TSA-friendly if you’re traveling, and most 
    importantly, spill-resistant. Read on for 10 pencils to swap into your makeup bag, stat. No sharpeners required!
